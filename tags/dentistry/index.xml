      <description>Vibratory thumbler is a useful machine, when casting plaster and polishing CNC parts. I use it mainly for bubble-free castings with silicone, epoxy and plaster, as vibrations facilitate the air, trapped in the small pockets near the surface to escape.
Old braking disc serves as a solid base, to which spring mounted table is mount. The machine is powered by some old high-pole DC motor, offering low speed and high torque, to which the eccentric cam is mounted for debalance.</description>
