      <description>For three years in a row I attended the three days blacksmithing workshop, organized by Slovenian Blacksmith Association, Section Plamen. The workshop took place at the blacksmith shop of the master Jernej Zorko in Župeča Vas, one of the last artistic blacksmiths in Slovenia. Apart of learning basic blacksmithing techniques, we also had the opportunity to try and blacksmith something on our own.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made two sculptures by different technologies. The owl is made by welding steel fathers to a to a smith steel frame.</description>
