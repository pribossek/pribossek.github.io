      <description>The idea for this project is pretty old and roots back to 2014. I decided to build a special shaped coffe cup, looking classic on the outside, but revealing its secret heart as the coffe level drops to half. What started as a simple birthday gift for my girlfriend, ended up as a 6 years long journey of ups and down,with some extraordinary long pauses as I did not know how to proceed.</description>

      <title>Shack Hartmann Sensor</title>

      <guid>https://jaka.pribosek.com/home/shackhartmann/</guid>
      <description>I developed two versions of a Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor and wrote a custom image processing algorithms to estimate the optical aberrations of optical system. The working principle is simple. The input wavefront is divided into several different channels, each focused with its own microlens. Sensor is placed in the focal plane of the microlens array. Any local tilt of the wavefront shifts the point from its central position. A custom Python algorithm finds center of each individual spots, orders them on the grid and performs the modal analysis, projection on the orthogonal Zernike polynomials basis.</description>

      <description>Spherometer is an instrument used to measure the sag of the lens and inspect the progress during a rough grinding process. As a measurement head, Mitutoyo 543-390B ID-C112XB is used which provides absolute accuracy with micrometer resolution. Aluminium holder was CNC machined from a 10mm thick scrap sheet. The setup is calibrated on a flat calibrated surface plate and used to asses sag of the telescope mirror during the grinding process.</description>

      <description>Grinding a telescope mirror with your bare hands until its surface is matching a desired shape to few nanometer is a unique experience.
I decided to design, construct and built an 12inch travel telescope.</description>

      <description>I got a big old heavy duty cinema projector lens as my farewell gift when I left my research stay in Germany. I decided to use modify it and use it as a camera lens.</description>

      <title>Vibratory Thumbler</title>

      <guid>https://jaka.pribosek.com/home/vibratorythumbler/</guid>
      <description>Vibratory thumbler is a useful machine, when casting plaster and polishing CNC parts. I use it mainly for bubble-free castings with silicone, epoxy and plaster, as vibrations facilitate the air, trapped in the small pockets near the surface to escape.
Old braking disc serves as a solid base, to which spring mounted table is mount. The machine is powered by some old high-pole DC motor, offering low speed and high torque, to which the eccentric cam is mounted for debalance.</description>

      <description>I built several microlens arrays with different technologies, reflow lithography, with subsequent reactive ion etching, electromagnetic imprinting to produce molds, used in an embossing process to produce lenses, and last, ion exchange process to change the refractive index using KNO3 and AGNO3 molten salt baths.
I used a lens to build a Shack-Hartmann sensor, which was built entirely from scratch. </description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made this LED display for a friend of mine, who happens to be a big football fan.
A stand was carved out of spruce with a 6mm ballnose mill. The stock material has been mount inclined 20° on the CNC while the pocket was curved. The display is made out of plexi glass, engraved with 60° V-cutter, dived 0.5mm in material, with 0.75mm pitch. Underneath the plexiglass, there are 6 green LEDs, secretly placed in the pocket in the stand.</description>

      <description>I have made this wrench to open my brothers watch (Casio Edifice EFR546D) and replace the battery during the Christmas holidays this year. I could just order the watch repair kit from eBay or similair, however lead times were all far longer what we were prepared to wait. We needed it right on spot, so I modelled it in a Fusion360 and went to my workshop. First, I have turned an aluminium rod on the lathe to a size, drilled a bore and cut a M6 thread through its center and parted it off.</description>

      <description>I have made this nice spice rack out of 30mm spruce plank. The spice rack measures 150 x 450 x 30 mm. It was carved in two pieces, as the cnc working area is 300mm in the longest dimension. So I set up two separate gcode, both referenced to the same physical point on the object. The point was found on CNC using a camera, hence
As final finish, I used linseed oil, which pops out the grain a bit and gives a nice mate finish.</description>

      <description>For three years in a row I attended the three days blacksmithing workshop, organized by Slovenian Blacksmith Association, Section Plamen. The workshop took place at the blacksmith shop of the master Jernej Zorko in Župeča Vas, one of the last artistic blacksmiths in Slovenia. Apart of learning basic blacksmithing techniques, we also had the opportunity to try and blacksmith something on our own.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made two sculptures by different technologies. The owl is made by welding steel fathers to a to a smith steel frame.</description>

      <description>Made for my love.
Designed in Inkscape as bitmap, converted by bmp2gcode converter. Frontside carved with 60degree carbide cutter, backside and the contour carved out with 1.8mm endmill cutter. Oiled with a linseed oil as final finish. I made this while staying in Ilmenau, Thüringen in a small dorm on a CNC, I have installed in the room. Took several approaches and several nights CNC-ying to get the things right (especially with 3D modelling using 50 shades of gray)</description>

      <title>Deformable Mirror</title>

      <description>As a side project of my PhD, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed an adaptive optical system with a custom built deformable mirror. Deformable mirror was developed out of a piezo buzzer to which at the frontside, a small coated objective glass, ground to the round shape has been bonded. Piezo electrode has been segmented into four electrically isolated segments. By applying different voltages to the segments, the curvature of the mirror can be controlled.</description>

      <description>A wedding gift for a friend Matevž. It is a version of a nordic love-spoon, that once vikings used to make for their loved ones. The hand symbolyse the friendship, the heart the true love, the knot the eternity and finally the crown the nobleness. The lovespoon is made out of spruce, entirely without power tools, just hacksaw, chisels, sanding paper and elbow grease. Unfortunately, photos of the carving process have been lost through the years.</description>

      <description>I casted the engagement ring from sterling silver and wedding rings from 18 carat white gold (gold-nickel). From mastering lost-wax process to casting fine details, I decided to develop the technology from scratch, which happened to be quite a stressful journey.
First, everythign started by designing the ring in the Fusion360.</description>
