      <description>This mad-max style centrifugal machine was built entirely out of various scrap I had lying around. At a heart of the machine is a front flange of an old induction motor and the corresponding motor shaft. The shaft is clamped in the vice, so the bearing can spin around freely. To the flange, the bowl, retrieved from an old hot-water tank, is mounted and the metal arm, holding the casting mould and the counterweight.</description>

      <description>The idea for this project is pretty old and roots back to 2014. I decided to build a special shaped coffe cup, looking classic on the outside, but revealing its secret heart as the coffe level drops to half. What started as a simple birthday gift for my girlfriend, ended up as a 6 years long journey of ups and down,with some extraordinary long pauses as I did not know how to proceed.</description>

      <description>I casted the engagement ring from sterling silver and wedding rings from 18 carat white gold (gold-nickel). From mastering lost-wax process to casting fine details, I decided to develop the technology from scratch, which happened to be quite a stressful journey.
First, everythign started by designing the ring in the Fusion360.</description>
